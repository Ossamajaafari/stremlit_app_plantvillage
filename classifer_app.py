    Welcome to the Plant Disease Recognition System! üåøüîç

    Our mission is to help identify plant diseases efficiently. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!

    ### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system will process the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
    3. **Results:** View the results and recommendations for further action.

    ### Why Choose Us?
    - **Accuracy:** Our system utilizes state-of-the-art machine learning techniques for accurate disease detection.
    - **User-Friendly:** Simple and intuitive interface for seamless user experience.
    - **Fast and Efficient:** Receive results in seconds, allowing for quick decision-making.

    ### Additional Features
    - **Image Processing:** Visit the **Image Processing** page to explore various techniques such as grayscale conversion, resizing, edge detection, and more. These tools help enhance and analyze plant images before disease recognition.
    - **Tools Used:** Our system is built using advanced tools and technologies including Streamlit for the web application, TensorFlow for machine learning, OpenCV for image processing, and PIL for image handling.

    ### Get Started
    Click on the **Disease Recognition** page in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the power of our Plant Disease Recognition System!

    ### About the Plant Disease Recognition System

    The Plant Disease Recognition System is designed to help farmers and gardeners identify diseases in their crops quickly and accurately. Utilizing state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, our system analyzes uploaded images of plants and detects potential diseases, providing users with detailed information and recommendations for treatment.

    #### Our Team
    This project is developed by a team of first-year Master's students at ENSET Mohammedia:

    - **Eljaafari Ossama**: Responsible for data preprocessing and model training.
    - **AITSIRIR Tarik**: Focuses on the web application development and integration.
    - **ISMAOUI Rabii**: Specializes in image processing techniques and model optimization.

    #### About Dataset
    The dataset used in this project consists of approximately 87,000 RGB images of healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different classes. The images are divided into training, validation, and test sets in an 80/20 ratio.

    - **Train:** 70,295 images
    - **Validation:** 17,572 images
    - **Test:** 33 images

    The dataset was augmented offline to ensure robustness and variety.

    #### How It Works
    1. **Upload Image:** Go to the **Disease Recognition** page and upload an image of a plant with suspected diseases.
    2. **Analysis:** Our system processes the image using advanced algorithms to identify potential diseases.
